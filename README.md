# PA2-Avalanche Effect in DES Rounds


## Avalanche Effect

A small change in either the plaintext or the key should produce
a large effect in ciphertext.

Also, DES exhibits a strong Avalanche Effect.


## Description of project

In this project, Analysis of Avalanche effect for in DES 
in each round is done, by comparing hamming distnces of corresponding plaintexts.

- Part-1
In this part, i have analysed 5-different pairs of Plaintexts, each pair having Hamming Distance 1. They key used for Each pair of PlainTexts is the same.

- Part-2
In this Part, I have analyzed 5-different Hamming Distances (1,2,3,4,5). I have chosen 5 Different Pairs of PlainTexts, 1st pair has hamming distance 1, 2nd Hamming Distance 2, and like this 5th Pair Hamming Distance 5. The key used for Each pair of PlainTexts is the same.

- Part-3
In this Part, I have analyzed 5-different pairs of Secret keys, each pair with Hamming Distance 1. They PlainText used for Each pair of Secret Keys is the same.
